> ## Theme : _Mental state and awareness_

### Project Description
### _**'Let's Cure'**_ is based on the ideals of Mental Health Awareness.
#### During these hard times, amongst all the help coming up, chaos is also winding up. “Where” to find “what” and “how” are becoming real questions. <br>
#### To help up out of this clutter, we have brought together the information, various sources and tips that can help people understand the  importance of mental health and take initiative in improving it through simple and effective means.
